# Folding Stats

## Development

### jOOQ Database Access

We use **jOOQ** for generating SQL queries (as seen in *PostgresDbManager.java*). We use **jOOQ** code generation to
generate files to make query builder simpler and able to conform to schemas. This requires a few steps when the DB
changes:

- Start the test containers ("Executing tests")
- Update the `docker/postgres/jooq/jooq-config.xml` file with the DB connection properties if not using the default
- Run the `generate.bat` batch file, which will generate the schemas (starting in a directory named `me`)
- Traverse the `me` directory until you get to `gen` (full path is `me/zodac/folding/db/postgres/gen`)
- Move the `gen` directory and all contents
  into `folding-stats/folding-stats-jar/src/main/java/me/zodac/folding/db/postgres`
    - Overwrite any existing files (or delete beforehand)

Once this is done, it will be possible to reference the DB tables/fields/schema from *PostgresDbManager.java* to assist
with SQL query generation.

### JS/CSS Updates

The JS scripts and CSS stylesheets are stored in `docker/frontend/src`. They are then minified and merged by a maven
plugin, which copies them into the 'live' folder `docker/frontend/site/res`. This is done by running the following
command in the `folding-stats/docker` directory:

    maven package -Dminify

If this command is not running, changes will not be pushed to the frontend container.

### REST RAML API

The REST endpoints are documented through RAML, with the source RAML file found in  `docker/frontend/src/raml/api.raml`.
This is used to generate an HTML output which is saved to `docker/frontend/site/api.html`, and can be accessed through
the UI.

To update the RAML HTML, you will first need to install **raml2html**. You will need **NodeJS** and then to execute:

    npm i -g raml2html

Once **raml2html** is installed, the RAML HTML output can be generated by running the following command in the
`folding-stats/docker` directory:

    maven install -Draml

## Decisions

### Historic Stats

We're using a couple of queries to read the user stats from the TC stats table, but not persisting hourly/daily/monthly
stats. This might be a bit slow if there is frequent access to the historic pages, so there is a potential for
caching/persisting results. Could be persisted on a scheduled basis, or perhaps only persisted on the first call, then
cache those results. Need to do more profiling on a live system, see how much it is being used. (A good idea to bring in
an ELK stack to instrument the system when we go live.)

### Enabling DEBUG Logs

This requires us to connect to the `wildfly` container, so we will need the container ID:

    $ docker container ls
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS                                            NAMES
    c669fe278e36        folding-stats_wildfly    "/opt/jboss/wildfly/…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes             0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9990->9990/tcp   wildfly
    334ace4ab4be        folding-stats_postgres   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   3 minutes ago       Up 3 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp                           postgres

Then connect to this container (if using Linux, ignore the `winpty` at the start of the command):

    $ winpty docker exec -it c669fe278e36 bash
    [root@wildfly jboss]#

This gives us access to the Wildfly container. Now we connect to the console:

    [root@wildfly jboss]# ./wildfly/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect
    [standalone@localhost:9990 /]

Finally, we update both the logger for our code, and the CONSOLE logger (otherwise the debug logs will be available in
the log file only):

    [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging/logger=me.zodac.folding:write-attribute(name=level, value=DEBUG)
    {"outcome" => "success"}
    [standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=logging/console-handler=CONSOLE:write-attribute(name=level, value=DEBUG)
    {"outcome" => "success"}

### How to extract Wildfly logs on container crash

A volume `wildfly_logs` should exist. We cannot retrieve the file directly from the volume. Instead, we create a
lightweight docker container, and attach the volume to this container. We can then copy the file from the container to
the host system.

For example, first check the available volumes:

    $ docker volume ls
    DRIVER VOLUME NAME
    local 97f3b514d34ebc85ebd71c61d1701b7faf585c2c755c62f78bea798b5a150c35
    local folding-stats_postgres_data
    local folding-stats_wildfly_logs

Then create a simple container, attaching the `folding-stats_wildfly_logs` volume (in read-only mode):

    docker container create --name dummy -v folding-stats_wildfly_logs:/root:ro folding-stats_wildfly
    docker cp dummy:/root/server.log ./server.log
    docker rm dummy
